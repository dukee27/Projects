## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements (the dice button)
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon (using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com))

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Custom Properties (Variables)
- Flexbox & Grid
- Mobile-first responsive design
- JavaScript `fetch()` and async/await
- [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com)

---

### What I Learned

I practiced:

- Centering a component using `flexbox` and `absolute` positioning
- Using `fetch()` with `async/await` for API integration
- Dynamically updating DOM elements with JavaScript
- Theming with `:root` CSS variables

Here‚Äôs a snippet I‚Äôm proud of:

```js
const diceBtn = document.getElementById("dice-btn");
const adviceId = document.getElementById("advice-id");
const adviceText = document.getElementById("advice-text");

async function getAdvice() {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.adviceslip.com/advice");
  const data = await res.json();
  adviceId.textContent = `Advice #${data.slip.id}`;
  adviceText.textContent = `"${data.slip.advice}"`;
}

diceBtn.addEventListener("click", getAdvice);
